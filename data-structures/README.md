# Data Structures

Six practice problems focusing on caches, file search, Huffman coding, group membership, blockchains, and linked list set ops.

## Files
- `problem_1.py` … `problem_6.py`: solutions with inline tests and expected-output comments.
- `explanation_1.md` … `explanation_6.md`: design/efficiency summaries.

## Running
From this folder:
```bash
python problem_1.py
python problem_2.py
python problem_3.py
python problem_4.py
python problem_5.py
python problem_6.py
```
Each script prints its test outputs.

## Notes
- Standard library only; no extra dependencies.
- Sorting avoided except where inherent to problem design.
